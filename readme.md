### This app reads data from PokerStars game.
PokerStars windows don't have to be even visible.

At the moment this app recons:
* Cards on table

I will add some new features like game-stage recon and player's cards soon

To make it work you need to set up orange table and default four colors cards!


### It uses tesseract, opencv, pywin32, numpy and Pillow
